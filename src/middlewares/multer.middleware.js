                           |  |  |  |  |  |

destination-> (diskstorage vs memory storage)


Disk Storage:diskStorage is a storage engine in Multer that saves the uploaded files directly to the disk. This is how it works:

Location: Files are stored on the disk (hard drive or SSD) in a specified directory.


Pros: Persistent storage, handles large files well, configurable storage location and filename.
Cons: Slower I/O operations, requires cleanup of stored files.

Memory Storage: memoryStorage is a storage engine in Multer that stores the uploaded files in memory as Buffer objects.Files are stored in the 
                serverâ€™s memory (RAM)
        buffer- a buffer is a region of physical memory storage used to temporarily store data while it is being moved from one place to another

Pros: Fast access, suitable for small files, easy to use for temporary file handling.
Cons: Non-persistent, limited by server memory, not suitable for large files.
