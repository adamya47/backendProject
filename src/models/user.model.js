/**
 bcrypt
 bcrypt.js is a JavaScript library commonly used for hashing passwords and ensuring secure storage and authentication of user credentials. 
 Hereâ€™s why bcrypt.js is widely used:

 Strong Hashing Algorithm: bcrypt is based on the Blowfish cipher and is designed to be computationally intensive, making it resistant 
 to brute force attacks.
Salt Generation: bcrypt automatically generates a salt for each password, which ensures that even if two users have the same password, 
their hashed passwords will be different.
Adaptive Hashing: bcrypt allows you to increase the complexity of the hashing process over time as computational power increases,
 by adjusting the "cost factor" or salt round

 How Salt works
 Generate a Salt: A random value is generated. The length of the salt is often a fixed size.

Combine Salt and Password: The salt is combined with the password, usually by concatenating them.

Hash the Combined Value: The combined salt and password are then passed through the hash function to produce the hash output.

Store the Salt with the Hash: The salt is stored alongside the hash in the database. This allows the salt to be used again when verifying the
 password.
